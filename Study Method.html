    <h3>Full Course explanation</h3>

      <p>Welcome to the Complete Web Development Bootcamp, the only course you need to learn to code and become a full-stack web developer. With 150,000+ ratings and a 4.8 average, my Web Development course is one of the HIGHEST RATED courses in the history of Udemy! 
        <br />
      At 65+ hours, this Web Development course is without a doubt the most comprehensive web development course available online. Even if you have zero programming experience, this course will take you from beginner to mastery. Here's why:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The course is taught by the lead instructor at the App Brewery, London's leading in-person programming bootcamp.</li>
          <li>The course has been updated to be 2023 ready and you'll be learning the latest tools and technologies used at large companies such as Apple, Google and Netflix.</li>
          <li>This course doesn't cut any corners, there are beautiful animated explanation videos and tens of real-world projects which you will get to build.</li>
          <li>The curriculum was developed over a period of four years, with comprehensive student testing and feedback.</li>
          <li>We've taught over a million students how to code and many have gone on to change their lives by becoming professional developers or starting their own tech startup.</li>
          <li>You'll save yourself over $12,000 by enrolling, but still get access to the same teaching materials and learn from the same instructor and curriculum as our in-person programming bootcamp.</li>
          <li>The course is constantly updated with new content, with new projects and modules determined by students - that's you!
          </li>
        </ul>

     <br />
      <p>We'll take you step-by-step through engaging video tutorials and teach you everything you need to know to succeed as a web developer.
        <br />  
      The course includes over 65 hours of HD video tutorials and builds your programming knowledge while making real-world websites and web apps.</p>
